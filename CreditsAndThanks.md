# Credits and thanks #

The wrappers around Mecab and Kakasi, as well as the dictionary-lookup code, come from Damien Elmes <a href='http://ichi2.net/anki/wiki/JapaneseSupport'>Japanese plugin for Anki</a>.  Of course, I am also grateful to him for creating Anki in the first place!

I drew inspiration from "Tokyostyle's" <a href='http://code.google.com/p/mcdsupport/'>MCD plugin for Anki</a>. It creates MCDs much faster and easier than my scripts, and I highly recommend it.

The interface to Google's TTS comes from Arthur Helfstein Fragoso's <a href='http://code.google.com/p/googletts-anki/'>Googletts</a> plugin.

The file of Heisig keywords comes from a shared Anki deck called "Heisig's Remember the Kanji (RTK) 1+3."  I can't find an author listed for this, but whoever you are, thanks!

And, of course, thanks to Khatzumoto for <a href='http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/'>ajatt</a>!
