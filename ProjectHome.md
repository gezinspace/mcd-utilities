<a href='http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/'>All Japanese All The Time</a> (or ajatt) is an approach to learning Japanese, or any other language.

A key feature of this approach is the use of a spaced repetition system.  <a href='http://ankisrs.net/'>Anki</a> is one such system, providing "friendly, intelligent flashcards."

<a href='http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/mcd-revolution'>MCD (Massive-Context Cloze Deletion) cards</a> are a particular kind of flashcard format recommended on ajatt.

This project contains utilities for working with MCDs, in particular MCDGenerator is a script for turning a chunk of text into a file of MCDs including dictionary lookups and audio.  This file can then be imported into Anki.

For installation and running instructions please see <a href='http://code.google.com/p/mcd-utilities/wiki/GettingStarted'>Getting started</a>.
