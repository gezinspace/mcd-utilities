The mcd-utilities need a few things in order to run

  * [The Python programming language](http://www.python.org) This is already available on most versions of OS X
  * [Mecab](http://code.google.com/p/mecab/) and [Kakasi](http://kakasi.namazu.org/).  The easiest way to get these is to install the Anki [Japanese plugin](http://ankisrs.net/docs/JapaneseSupport.html#Installing_the_plugin)... which you probably already have!
  * If you are using OS X 10.7 ("Lion") you can use Apple's Text-to-speech system to create audio for your cards.  Install the "Kyoko" voice according to [these instructions](http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/24/os-x-lion-introduces-new-multilingual-high-quality-text-to-spe/)
